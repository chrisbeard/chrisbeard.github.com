			<p>I'm a rising-junior at Binghamton University, where I study Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>

			<p>Lately, I've been interested in hackathons, web development, and slacklining.</p>

			<p>I am excited to announce that I'll be doing research at the Rome Labs Air Force Base as an intern this summer.</p>

			<p>I've been playing trombone since 2003, and I currently study with Don Robertson at Binghamton University.</p>

			<p>I am a member of Don's low brass studio ensemble, as well as the Binghamton University Symphony Orchestra, which is directed by Dr. Timothy Perry.</p>

			<p>You might also see me play in some of the music department's recitals, or at Binghamton's commencement ceremonies.</p>

			<p>I make multi-track recordings of myself on trombone, and compose alternative electronic music. Some of my work is available on <a href="http://souncloud.com/trombeard">soundcloud</a>.</p>

			<p>I just finished working on a research project with <a href="http://github.com/kjohns19">Kevin Johnson</a>, where we tried to create secure memory compartments on the OpenRISC CPU.</p>

			<p>I've been hacking! I had a great time at HackPrinceton and HackBU this semester, and look forward to future hackathons. You can check out my hacks on my <a href="http://challengepost.com/users/chrisbeard">challengepost</a> page.</p>

			<p>I'm working with <a href="http://itaiferber.net">Itai</a> to develop <a href="http://seemeco.de">seemeco.de</a>, a site which helps programmers build up a GitHub portfolio. We started it at HackPrinceton, where it won Wolfram Alpha's Best Education Hack.</p>

			<p>Speaking of GitHub, you can find mine <a href="http://github.com/chrisbeard">here</a>.</p>
